With `itmedia2` you can build your own little industry directory for your
TYPO3 website. It comes with a list and a configurable detail view. Above the
list view we implemented an A-Z navigation to jump directly to industry
directory entries which will start with clicked starting letter.

This extension is a lightweight version of `yellowpages2` without a frontend
form, without mailing, without scheduler task.
